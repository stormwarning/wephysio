                <h3>Craig Brososky</h3>
                <p>Craig Brososky, owner of WePhysio and a clinical educator at the University of Alberta, received both his science degrees from the University of Alberta in Edmonton where he was born and raised. The river valley of Edmonton, which has the largest greenway of any city in North America, has provided him ample opportunity for cycling, running, cross-country skiing, and exploration and has served as a backdrop to both the learning and teaching process that Craig has enjoyed for over twenty years. Along with being a clinical educator and published author of articles on low back pain management, sport ergogenics, and injury prevention, Craig is a registered Injury Management Consultant with the Insurance Bureau of Canada and the College of Physical Therapists. Craig believes you can never stop learning and loves the lifelong challenge of educating both individuals and groups.</p>

                <h3>Graham Ciciarelli</h3>
                <p>Graham Ciciarelli completed his Bachelor of Science in occupational therapy at the University of Alberta. His clinical experience during the program included time at the Hinton General Hospital, the Alberta Hospital, Millard Health and in the Hazeldean Early Education Program. After completing his education, he managed a private clinic before working as the regional manager of occupational therapy for CBI Health. In 2006 he founded his own consulting service where he works with employers in the prevention, treatment, and management of injuries related to and sustained outside of work. He has interest and experience in areas that vary from office and industrial ergonomics to return to work planning to functional capacity evaluations.</p>
                <p>Graham subscribes to the WePhysio philosophy on wellness and enjoys an active lifestyle himself through cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and mountain biking. Belonging is as important an ingredient in wellness as activity and Graham finds that in his family. He once scored a hole in one golfing with his father on Father’s Day, shares a birthday with his young son, and finds ways to enjoy the outdoors with his family as much as possible.</p>

                <h3>Mel Muise</h3>
                <p>Mel Muise embodies the WePhysio definition of performance. She has been a competitive runner for seventeen years and with each run learns something new about herself and how she runs. Every success she realizes and, equally as important, every failure has strengthened her knowledge and enhanced her ability to perform. She is grateful to have been coached by wonderful teachers in the art of running so it seems natural that she is now working on gaining her own coaching certification. Her philosophy is simple: A good running program is based on proven training principles for the development of the complete runner and everyone can master the skills. Mel is continually training for performance events and for each she sets herself challenging performance goals.</p>

He has given numerous injury prevention talks through the Running Room and has completed two full marathons and many half marathons.
