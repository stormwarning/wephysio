            <p>At WePhysio we see wellness as regaining an optimal state of health. Whether you are recovering from an injury, surgery or a lingering long-term pain, whatever is preventing you from being whole in your health is what we aim to help you fix. We want to see everyone moving and living in their best physical form. We offer several services to assist you in recovery and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p>We are a Workerâ€™s Compensation Board (WCB) approved clinic. If you suffer an injury on the job or in the workplace and require physiotherapy to assist in your recovery, we can assist you in finding the right treatment for your injury and in making your claim.</p>
            <p>We can process Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) claims. If you have been in a motor vehicle accident and suffered an injury, you have a limited time to file a claim with your insurance company. We can assist you with the forms and submission and will find the correct course of treatment to alleviate your pain and discomfort and bring you back to full health.</p>
            <p>We have the ability to directly bill certain extended health providers to make the burden of paperwork in your daily life an easier one to bear.</p>
            <p>We are able to provide Functional Capacity Evaluations (FCE) and ergonomic assessments. Simply call our office and discuss the evaluation you require with our staff.</p>
            <p>We can help you get back to your life free of injury discomfort and limitations and with better mobility. Wellness is an achievable goal for you.</p>
